# shippy-examples

A collection of example scripts using the Ship Python API.

Note that these scripts depend on having the Ship Python API installed.

It can be installed with the following:
```
sudo pip install shippy
```

If that fails because you don't have pip installed, you can install it via easy_install:
```
sudo easy_install pip && sudo pip install shippy
```
